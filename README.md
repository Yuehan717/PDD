## 📝Absract
Existing methods approach Real-World Super-Resolution (RWSR) by learning blind general models through complex synthetic augmentation on training inputs; they sacrifice the performance on specific degradation for broader generalization to many possible ones. We address the **unsupervised RWSR** for a targeted real-world degradation. We study from a distillation perspective and introduce a novel Pairwise Distance Distillation framework.
Through our framework, a model specialized in synthetic degradation adapts to target real-world degradations by distilling intra- and inter-model distances across the specialized model and an auxiliary generalized model.
